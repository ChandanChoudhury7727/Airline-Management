This project is a Java-based airline management system designed to streamline 
various tasks related to customer management, ticket booking, flight scheduling, 
and user administration. The system is built using Java Swing for the graphical 
user interface (GUI) components and MySQL for database management.


Key Features:
Customer Management: The system allows airline staff to add new customers and 
search for existing ones, facilitating efficient management of customer 
information such as names, contact details, and passport information.
Ticket Booking: Users can book tickets for flights through a simple and intuitive 
interface. The system handles ticket reservations, seat allocations, and generates 
booking reports for easy tracking.
Flight Management: Staff members can add new flights to the system, specifying 
details such as flight numbers, departure/arrival times, and destination airports. 
This feature ensures accurate scheduling and management of flight operations.
User Administration: The system includes user management functionality, 
allowing administrators to create new user accounts with specific roles and 
permissions. This ensures proper access control and security within the 
application.
